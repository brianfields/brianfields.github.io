Windsor, resulted in the Supreme Court striking down part of a law that banned federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Soon after this, another Supreme Court ruling (Obergefell v. Hodges) ‘made same-sex marriage legal throughout the nation. These rulings mean that married same-sex couples are now entitled to the same rights enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. These rights include Social Security benefts, hospital visitation rights, healthcare benefits, and military family benefits. However, despite these advances, LGBT ‘people still have no federal law to protect them from discrimination in housing or employment.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">An Aging Population While the life expectancy of an American born in 1900 was less than 50 years, an American born in 2011 can expect live to age 79. By 2000, older Americans tended to tetire earlir, live longer, and exert more political influence. These factors have strained the country’s social welfare system, especially Social Security and Medicare. In 1960, the federal government spent less than $100 billion on social welfare. By 2013, the amount had increased to $1.9 trillion.</p>

<p class="zone zone-paragraph">On June 25, 2013, President Obama addressed an audience at Georgetown University on the subjectof the environment. Briefly mentioning that the twelve ‘warmest years in recorded history had occurted over the course of the previous fifteen years, he focused</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">on the problems of global warming:</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">Last year, temperatures in some areas of the ocean reached record highs, and ice in the Arctic shrank to its smallest size on record—faster than most models had predicted it would. These are facts.</p>

<p class="zone zone-paragraph">Coastal areas of the United States will be under threat if, as many scientists predict, the warming of the atmosphere leads to a rise in sea levels. In low- lying areas of Florida, high tides are already leading 10 periodic flooding, especially in cities such as Miami. With Florida heavily dependent on tourism, an increase in sea levels could seriously affect the state’s economy. In Hawail, there is concern that sea levels, which have been rising for the last 100 years, may accelerate, threatening urban areas.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">But global warming has implications far beyond rising seas. The Environmental Protection Agency teports that in Alaska, where the increase in warming temperatures is more than twice the warming in the rest of the United States, orest wildfires are increasing, while sea ice is decreasing. Lakes are changing size, and permaftost is thawing. ‘This melting permafrost, which may lead to ground subsidence, is a direct threat to transportation networks and buildings.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">Legislating to Protect the Environment In recent years, environmental issues have aroused political controversy. Some deny that our planet is experiencing a period of warming temperatures. Others, while accepting global warming as fact, deny that such warming is the product of human activity. Those who believe that human activity</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">s the cause of global warming have wiged the federal government to move forcefully to pass envitonmental legislation. But given the variety</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">of opinion on environmental matters, it is not surprising that government regulations have attracted plenty of opposition. The main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation’s industries.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">During the Obama administration, regulations were passed to control emissions from power plants, prompting many coal industry officials to condemn the administration for waging a “war on coal.” Many Republicans also criticized Obama’s efforts to support renewable energy. When Donald Trump became president, he attemped to roll back Obama&#39;s environmental efforts, signing an executive order limiting the government&#39;s enforcement of climate tegulations. Trump claimed that this would help protect American jobs.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">The Environment and Local Economies Environmental issues have become controversial largely because the environment is closely tied to local economies. The continental United States can be divided into four main environmental regions: the Wes, the South, the Northeast, and the Midwest. In the West, water is an important environmental and</p>

<p class="zone zone-paragraph">economic issue because it is so scaice. Population growth and drought put pressure on this important tesource, which must be shared by private homes and businesses. Recent periods of drought in California, which supplies produce to the nation, have had a dramatic effect on the state’s farming economy.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">‘The West is also a region with vast tracts of land owned by the federal government. The government&#39;s ‘management of this land touches issucs of mining, logging, grazing and other development. In recent years the opening up of oil and gas development on public land has become a controversial issue.</p>
<p class="zone zone-paragraph">Other regions face different environmental issues. ‘The 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico created environmental problems along the coast of many Southern states. In the Midwest, the Keystone XL pipeline project has attracted protesters and litigation to stop it. This pipeline, which would transport crude oil from Canada to the oil refineries of the Gulf of Mexico, was opposed by President Obama but approved by President Trump. Gritics have condemned this project for its possible damage to the environment, while the project’s supporters promise that it will bring jobs and a reliable oil supply.</p>
